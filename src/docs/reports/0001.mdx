## Asleep at the post

A King, weary from battle, sleeping on the job. As discussed previously afk with auto click is not allowed. Whether you fell asleep or not I have no real way of knowing and it would leave a loophole to claim being aslee so the punishment will be consistent for clarity on the rule. I did notice you were not responsing last night and the first punishment is just to kick to prevent further damage done. Next offence is a /warn (these do have a limit of 4 before temp ban is issued). Should a warning be issued because I failed to /kick? I think not on this occasion. The only extra punishment would of been that I reset your levels but you died so that is a non-factor now.

## Vigilantes on the rise

With the revelations that witchcraft is once more prominent, Dildoggers of the South have risen to take justice into their own hands. Had you just killed Alan and not made a fuss you wouldn't have done anything wrong. It's a PVP zone and he would of had afk godmode is actually afk or been auto kicked.

However, I do have an issue with the toxic behaviour of killing and blackmailing in the name of the rules. If you meet him in the wild and want to blackmail for roleplay purposes (via DM's to avoid escalation) but to seek a benefit because he broke the rules is not on. Vigilantism causes escalation like this.
