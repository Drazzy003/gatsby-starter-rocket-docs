## Asleep at the post

A King, weary from battle, sleeping on the job. As discussed previously afk with auto click is not allowed. Whether you fell asleep or not I have no real way of knowing and it would leave a loophole to claim being asleep so the punishment will be consistent for clarity on the rule. I did notice you were not responsing last night and the first punishment is just to kick to prevent further damage done. Next offence is a /warn (these do have a limit of 4 before temp ban is issued). Should a warning be issued because I failed to /kick? I think not on this occasion. The only extra punishment would of been that I reset your levels to avoid a benefit being given from the overnight farming but you died so that is a non-factor now.

**Issue: AFK Farming**

**Proof:**

**Punishment: Pseudo kick punishment & xp reset to 0 (No further action necessary as you already lost this). Next offence /warn.**


## Vigilantes on the rise

With the revelations that witchcraft is once more prominent, Dildoggers of the South have risen to take justice into their own hands. Had you just killed Alan and not made a fuss you wouldn't have done anything wrong. It's a PVP zone and he would of had afk godmode is actually afk or been auto kicked.

However, I do have an issue with the toxic behaviour of killing and blackmailing in the name of the rules. If you meet him in the wild and want to blackmail for roleplay purposes (via DM's to avoid escalation) but to seek a benefit because he broke the rules is not on. Vigilantism causes escalation like this.

**Issue: Vigilantes**

**Proof:**

**Punishment: /warn Drazzy003 toxic behaviour**

**Other actions: Please return Alan's items.**


## It rhymes with hunt

We've all been there. You got beef and the buooyos gotta weigh in. This one is simple.

Future tip! Just don't get involded / argue. Just submit a report to me.

**Issue: Vulgar language**

**Proof: Available upon request to keep this website cat litter poop free**

**Punishment: /warn Alan3546 vulgar language, /warn Stabbyratbag vulgar language**


## Filthy Hobbitses

Right guys, that's all from me in terms of player punishments. I have to take some responsibility by failing to apply the /kick last night when I noticed Alan wasn't responding anymore. I also kinda fell asleep but hey... would of all been delt with subtly with Alan today. Not real punishment was necessary. He would of just been kicked to avoid gaining a benefit (sounds worse that it is being kicked. It's light dw).

For clarity is goes **verbal check > failing to respond = kick > repeat offence = /warn > 3rd offence = 24h ban

I'm allowing the use of autoclickers as I don't want any grinding to contribute to RSI. Please don't take the piss or I'll have to ban altogether.

Also, public warps have been deleted. Now that towny is in you are able to claim your land. Spawners can be moved too. The spawners that were located in /warp xpfarm belong to JJRM1194 and Getactive. They can sort that out between themselves.

From now on you'll have to build your own xp farms and use the home and outpost system to navigate.

The anti-cheat will now auto-kick for auto-clicking after a period of time. This means there will need to be a toggle on/off of your auto clicker every couple of minutes or you'll be kicked.

**It will be an offence to use any auto clickers that bypass the detection. Please check with me if your autolicker is allowed**.


Kind regards,
Rob (oHobbit)
