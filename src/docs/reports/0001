## Asleep at the post

A King, weary from battle, sleeping on the job. As discussed previously afk with auto click is not allowed. Whether you fell asleep or not I have no real way of knowing and it would leave a loophole to claim being aslee so the punishment will be consistent for clarity on the rule. I did notice you were not responsing last night and the first punishment is just to kick to prevent further damage done. Next offence is a /warn (these do have a limit of 4 before temp ban is issued). Should a warning be issued because I failed to /kick? I think not on this occasion. The only extra punishment would of been that I reset your levels but you died so that is a non-factor now.

**Punishment: Pseudo kick punishment & xp reset to 0. Next offence /warn.**
